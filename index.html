      <p>How many times have you been ask this question? Sure, one could point out the usual tourist traps but you don't want to be <span>that</span> friend.
         This is YOUR hood! You rep this city and you want to show them the hidden gems. The non-discriptive joint where locals go. Whether it's a taco truck posted up in the gas station parking lot,
         the no-frills burger joint with no seating, or the "best" fried chicken in town located inside of a gas station, you know where the spots are.</p>
      <p>My hope is to provide you, the visiting hungry masses, my curated list of good eats around Charlotte, NC and surrounding areas. I've also enlisted a few foodie friends to provide a list of their go-to for out of town visitors.</p>
